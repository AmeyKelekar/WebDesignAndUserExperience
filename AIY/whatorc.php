						<h1 class="entry-title">Reverse Auction??</h1>
						<hr>
						<p>
							A reverse auction is a type of auction in which the roles of buyer and seller are reversed. In an ordinary auction (also known as a forward auction), buyers compete to obtain a good or service by offering increasingly higher prices. In a reverse auction, the sellers compete to obtain business from the buyer and prices will typically decrease as the sellers undercut each other.
						</p>
						<p>
							A reverse auction is similar to a unique bid auction as the basic principle remains the same, however a unique bid auction follows the traditional auction format more closely as each bid is kept confidential and one clear winner is defined after the auction finishes.
							In business, the term most commonly refers to a specific type of auction process (also called procurement auction, e-auction, sourcing event, e-sourcing or eRA, eRFP, e-RFO, e-procurement, B2B Auction) used in government or private sector procurement.
						</p>
						<p>
							The most common application of reverse auctions is for E-procurement, a strategy used by purchasing as part of strategic sourcing and other supply management activities. It enables suppliers to compete on-line in real time and are changing the way firms and their consortia select and behave with their suppliers worldwide. It improves effectiveness of the sourcing process and facilitate access to new suppliers. It also leads to standardization of sourcing procedures, reduced order cycle, reduced prices and generally higher service levels.
						</p>
						<p>
							In a typical auction the seller offers an item which they wish to sell. Potential buyers are then free to bid on the item until the time period expires. The buyer with the highest offer wins the right to purchase the item for the price determined at the end of the auction.
						</p>
						<p>
							A reverse auction is different in that a single buyer offers a contract out for bidding (by either using specialized software or through an online marketplace). Multiple sellers are then able to offer bids on the contract. As the auction progresses, the price decreases as sellers compete to offer lower bids than their competitors whilst still meeting all of the specifications of the original contract.
						</p>
						<p>
							Bidding performed in real-time via the Internet results in a dynamic, competitive process. This helps achieve rapid downward price pressure that is not normally attainable using traditional static paper-based bidding processes.
						</p>
						<p>
							The buyer may award the contract to the seller who bid the lowest price. Or, a buyer may award contracts to suppliers who bid higher prices depending on the buyer's specific needs with regard to quality, lead-time, capacity, or other value-adding capabilities.
						</p>
						<p>
							The use of optimization software has become popular since 2002[clarification needed] to help buyers determine which supplier is likely to provide the best value in providing goods or services. The software includes relevant buyer and seller business data, including constraints.
						</p>
						<p>
							Reverse auctions are used to fill both large and small value contracts for both public sector and private commercial organizations. In addition to items traditionally thought of as commodities, reverse auctions are also used to source buyer-designed goods and services; and they have even been used to source reverse auction providers. The first time this occurred was in August 2001, when America West Airlines (now US Airways) used FreeMarkets software and awarded the contract to MaterialNet.
						</p>
						<p>
							In 2003, researchers claimed an average of 5% of total corporate spending was sourced using reverse auctions.[2] They have been found to be more appropriate and suitable in industries and sectors like advertising, auto components, bulk chemicals, consumer durables, computers and peripherals, contract manufacturing,courier, FMCG, healthcare, hospitality, insurance, leasing, logistics, maritime shipping, MRO, retail, software licesing, textiles, tourism, transport and warehousing. 
						</p>
						<p>
							Type of auction in which several sellers offer their items  for bidding, and compete for the price which a buyer will accept. The buyer  usually has the option to accept any bid or reject all. Bid-based construction  or supply contracts are examples of reverse auction. Also called business to  consumer auction.
						</p>
						<p>
							Majority of  auctions online are like any other process where buyers bid for a product and  the person with the highest bid takes away the product. There are a number of  well known site like Amazon and EBay that provide auctioning facility. There  are a number of other sites that follow the Reverse Auction process but our  website will provide the buyer with a unique Automation System that will help  the buyer decide the best bid for his requirements based on the base price.
